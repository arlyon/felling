#Felling
If you use this mod let me know! It's my first one and I'd love to get some feedback.

Click on one of the pages below for details about the enchantment and configuration:

*  [Configuration](config)

## Usage
Felling is a very simple mod, and fits very well into the original feeling of the game. The mod introduces a new enchantment to the world, Felling. It can be enchanted on any axe and when chopping down trees, cuts the entire tree down at once. It is quite common (occurring about half the time with a good number of bookshelves) and works just like you would expect any other enchantment to. There are two levels:
*  **Felling I** is uncommon, and will cut straight up and down, destroying all tree blocks in a vertical column. It pops up frequently with 15 bookshelves.
*  **Felling II** is quite rare and will destroy all the contiguous logs. It is still relatively hard to find even with 15 bookshelves.

## Support / Compatibility
This mod has been tested on Minecraft 1.11.2, but it should work on all 1.11.x versions. It may work on other versions but you'll have to test it yourself.
 
Additionally, the enchantment is compatible with any modded tool that uses the "axe" tool class, as well as all wood/leaves that are properly registered in the Ore Dictionary.

## Installation
Assuming you have Forge Mod Loader on Minecraft 1.11.x:
* Open your .minecraft folder
* Drop the jar file in your mods folder
* Start up the game and look at the configuration options
* ???
* Profit

When you have done this, the enchantment will be available in game. 

## Mod Packs
Feel free to use this in any mod-pack you please. I would appreciate a small mention back to this page but it's not necessary. Lastly, it would be cool if you send me a link to your pack so I can check it out!
